Simulation + Machine Learning Demos:

<hr />

* Demo of Reinforcement Learning within a simulation model built in AnyLogic
> A basic "capture a flag" model in which a "hidden" flag is placed on a mxn grid. The player has to capture the flag. When he/she does, a big reward is given; otherwise, a negative reward is imposed.
> One can play "manually". Or enable Q-learning - remember you may increase the simulation speed at the bottom. Say, x5 or x10 or x100 or x1000. Q-learning with stop at episode 2000. You may reduce to x1 after a few hundreds of episode as you may see the "agent" will play very decently after some learning.

* Demo of deep Q-learning network (DQN). A simulation model interacts with DQN built using Python. (to come ...)
