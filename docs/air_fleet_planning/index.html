            <p style="color: white">The model of management of aircraft fleet. Built by AnyLogic. The fleet consists of 20 aircrafts that need regular maintenance. There are
            two types of maintenance: week-based maintenance, which is scheduled according to the amount of weeks the aircraft is
            operated, and Hours-based maintenance is scheduled according to the amount of hours the aircraft has flown since last
            maintenance. The entire fleet has weekly planned rate of effort (in hours). If the fleet did not manage to operate this
            amount of time, the remaining hours (hours to catch up) are added to the next week's plan. You can play with individual
            rates of effort to minimize the amount of time to catch up. Alternatively, you can use the built-in OptQuest optimizer.</p>
